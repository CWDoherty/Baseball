The script to update the information in the database will be update.py.

This script calls three scripts: twitter.py, hashtags.py and user_mentions.py
In each of the above scripts, the 'config' variable will have to be changed to point to the correct database wherever this ends up.

If any table names are changed then the SQL statements within those 3 scripts will have to be changed as well to insert and select from the appropriate tables.
